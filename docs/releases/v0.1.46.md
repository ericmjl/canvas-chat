# Version 0.1.46

This release focuses on improving the test suite structure and documentation, making tests more maintainable and easier to run. It also includes a minor formatting fix for one of the test files.

## New Features

- Refactored the large test_utils.js file by splitting it into multiple focused test files that mirror the source code structure, improving test organization and maintainability. Added a shared test setup file and an automatic test discovery runner similar to pytest. (4c2c46) (Eric Ma)
