# Version 0.1.55

This release fixes two critical issues with code node interactions and improves the release workflow to prevent version number mismatches.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed code node scrolling not working after resize by extracting `findScrollableContainer()` utility that finds elements with actual overflow (not just CSS overflow property). The function walks up the DOM tree to find the deepest element with real scrollable content (`scrollHeight > clientHeight`), preventing scroll events from being incorrectly handled by elements that have `overflow: auto` CSS but no actual overflow. (dc33e18, 1d28073) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed output panel not following code nodes during resize by updating the resize handler to reposition output panels in real-time using the same centering logic as the drag handler. (7730471) (Eric Ma)
- Changed code execution indicator from hidden blue banner to pulsing header background for better visibility without interfering with scrolling. (78cbe29, c135f6e, f6051b0) (Eric Ma)
- Fixed release workflow to pass explicit `--version` flag to llamabot, preventing LLM from inferring incorrect version numbers from "Bump version" commit messages in release notes headers. (905ff23) (Eric Ma)

## Tests

- Added comprehensive test suite for `findScrollableContainer()` with 5 tests covering edge cases including: no scrollable containers, preferring ancestors with actual overflow, finding deeper elements with overflow, and horizontal scroll handling. (1d28073) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
