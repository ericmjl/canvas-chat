# Version 0.1.55

This release fixes two critical issues with code node interactions: scrolling inside resized code nodes, and output panel positioning during node resize.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed code node scrolling not working after resize by extracting `findScrollableContainer()` utility that finds elements with actual overflow (not just CSS overflow property). The function walks up the DOM tree to find the deepest element with real scrollable content (`scrollHeight > clientHeight`), preventing scroll events from being incorrectly handled by elements that have `overflow: auto` CSS but no actual overflow.

- Fixed output panel not following code nodes during resize by updating the resize handler to reposition output panels in real-time using the same centering logic as the drag handler. (7730471) (Eric Ma)
- Changed code execution indicator from hidden blue banner to pulsing header background for better visibility without interfering with scrolling. (78cbe29, c135f6e, f6051b0) (Eric Ma)

## Tests

- Added comprehensive test suite for `findScrollableContainer()` with 5 tests covering edge cases including: no scrollable containers, preferring ancestors with actual overflow, finding deeper elements with overflow, and horizontal scroll handling. (1d28073) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- None
